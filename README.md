The primary objective of this project is to increase the human likeness of robot movement.
Robots are primarily used for aiding humans in task completion, and we are more comfortable around human-like movements. Also, when comparing human and robot movements, human movements are always thought to be more efficient. Therefore, increasing the human likeness of the robot‘s movements will theoretically increase the movements' efficiency and the quality of the robot’s assistance.
